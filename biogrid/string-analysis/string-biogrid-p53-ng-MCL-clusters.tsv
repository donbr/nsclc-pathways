Forms tetrameric potassium- selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane. Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5, and possibly other family members as well [...] 
MCL	14	Medium Purple 2	#b075ef	2	CCDC54	9606.ENSP00000261058	Coiled-coil domain containing 54.
MCL	14	Medium Purple 2	#b075ef	2	TMCO2	9606.ENSP00000361852	Transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 2.
MCL	15	Orchid 2	#cf75ef	2	CHRFAM7A	9606.ENSP00000299847	CHRNA7-FAM7A fusion protein; CHRNA7 fusion.
MCL	15	Orchid 2	#cf75ef	2	GLRA1	9606.ENSP00000411593	Glycine receptor subunit alpha-1; Glycine receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels. Channel opening is triggered by extracellular glycine. Channel opening is also triggered by taurine and beta- alanine. Channel characteristics depend on the subunit composition; heteropentameric channels are activated by lower glycine levels and display faster desensitization. Plays an important role in the down-regulation of neuronal excitability. Contributes to the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Channel activity is potentiated by ethanol. Potentiation of channel activity by intoxi [...] 
MCL	16	Purple	#ee75ef	2	FUBP3	9606.ENSP00000318177	Far upstream element-binding protein 3; May interact with single-stranded DNA from the far-upstream element (FUSE). May activate gene expression.
MCL	16	Purple	#ee75ef	2	KHDC4	9606.ENSP00000357304	KH homology domain-containing protein 4; RNA-binding protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Interacts with the PRP19C/Prp19 complex/NTC/Nineteen complex which is part of the spliceosome. Involved in regulating splice site selection. Binds preferentially RNA with A/C rich sequences and poly-C stretches ; Belongs to the KHDC4 family.
MCL	17	Orchid	#ef75d2	2	COL14A1	9606.ENSP00000297848	Collagen alpha-1(XIV) chain; Plays an adhesive role by integrating collagen bundles. It is probably associated with the surface of interstitial collagen fibrils via COL1. The COL2 domain may then serve as a rigid arm which sticks out from the fibril and protrudes the large N-terminal globular domain into the extracellular space, where it might interact with other matrix molecules or cell surface receptors (By similarity).
MCL	17	Orchid	#ef75d2	2	OGN	9606.ENSP00000364711	Mimecan; Induces bone formation in conjunction with TGF-beta-1 or TGF- beta-2.
MCL	18	Hot Pink	#ef75b3	2	NABP1	9606.ENSP00000403683	SOSS complex subunit B2; Component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint. In the SOSS complex, acts as a sensor of single-stranded DNA that binds to single-stranded DNA, in particular to polypyrimidines. The SOSS complex associates with DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-s [...] 
MCL	18	Hot Pink	#ef75b3	2	RPUSD4	9606.ENSP00000298317	Mitochondrial RNA pseudouridine synthase RPUSD4; Catalyzes uridine to pseudouridine isomerization (pseudouridylation) of different mitochondrial RNA substrates. Acts on position 1397 in 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S mt-rRNA). This modification is required for the assembly of 16S mt-rRNA into a functional mitochondrial ribosome. Acts on position 39 in mitochondrial tRNA(Phe). As a component of a functional protein-RNA module, consisting of RCC1L, NGRN, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, FASTKD2 and 16S mt-rRNA, controls 16S mt-rRNA abundance and is required for intra-mitochondrial translatio [...] 
MCL	19	Pink	#ef7594	2	EDC4	9606.ENSP00000351811	Enhancer of mRNA-decapping protein 4; In the process of mRNA degradation, seems to play a role in mRNA decapping. Component of a complex containing DCP2 and DCP1A which functions in decapping of ARE-containing mRNAs. Promotes complex formation between DCP1A and DCP2. Enhances the catalytic activity of DCP2 (in vitro).
MCL	19	Pink	#ef7594	2	TAF1C	9606.ENSP00000455265	TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit C; Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, which is involved in the assembly of the PIC (preinitiation complex) during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. The rate of PIC formation probably is primarily dependent on the rate of association of SL1/TIF-IB with the rDNA promoter. SL1/TIF-IB is involved in stabilization of nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA. Formation of SL1/TIF-IB excludes the association of TBP with TFIID subunits. Recruits RNA polymerase I to the rRNA gene promoter via [...]
