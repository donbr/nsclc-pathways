# BioGRID

- consider this as a temporary placeholder for now

- as an initial search for synthetic lethality I recommend using the STRING "Geneset by Pathway / Process / Disease / Publication" search.
  - use a search terms similar to "TP53 synthetic lethality"
  - this search will focus on retrieving publications that will then be used to generate the graph network

- in many respects when querying for synthetic lethality / negative genetic interactor genes the most valuable column is the "Publication Source" (I think this mapped to around 7 PubMed references total)

- core files for TP53
  - [biogrid-synthetic-lethality-filtered-cols.csv](./biogrid-tp53-synthetic-lethality-filtered-cols.csv)
  - [biogrid-tp53-negative-genetic-filtered-cols.csv](./biogrid-tp53-negative-genetic-filtered-cols.csv)
- core files for RB1
  - stay tuned
