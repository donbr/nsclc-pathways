# Latest Therapeutic Targets in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Signaling Pathways: A Comprehensive Review and Network Analysis

## Abstract

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to evolve rapidly with recent FDA approvals and emerging therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes the latest developments in NSCLC therapeutic targets as of 2025, incorporating FDA approvals, breakthrough designations, and clinical trial data. Through integrated analysis of regulatory approvals, molecular studies, and pathway databases, we identify key therapeutic opportunities across multiple signaling axes. Notable advances include pan-RAS inhibitors targeting G12D mutations (RMC-6236), fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors overcoming C797S resistance (BLU-945, sunvozertinib), next-generation ALK inhibitors (TPX-0131, NVL-655), and novel antibody-drug conjugates (trastuzumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan). Recent approvals for NRG1 fusion-targeted therapy (zenocutuzumab) and the combination of lazertinib with amivantamab demonstrate the expanding therapeutic arsenal. This comprehensive mapping of the current therapeutic landscape provides a framework for personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.

## 1. Introduction

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The therapeutic landscape has undergone a transformative shift in 2024-2025, with 11 FDA approvals in 2024 alone reshaping treatment options. Notable advances include the FDA approval of zenocutuzumab-zbco for NRG1 fusion-positive NSCLC in December 2024, and the groundbreaking combination of lazertinib with amivantamab-vmjw for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

This review provides an integrated analysis of the latest therapeutic targets in NSCLC signaling pathways, incorporating recent FDA approvals, breakthrough designations, and clinical trial data to create a comprehensive therapeutic landscape for 2025.
