| Pathway | Primary Function | Key Components | Activation Mechanism | Main Effects |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway | Cell survival and anti-apoptosis | PI3K, AKT, BAD, CASP9, FOXO3 | Growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, ALK) | Inhibition of apoptosis |
| Ras Signaling Pathway | Cell proliferation regulation | RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK | Mutations in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS | Increased cell division |
| Calcium Signaling Pathway | Cell proliferation | PLCγ, IP3, DAG, Ca2+, PKC | PLCγ activation | Promotion of cell growth |
| p53 Signaling Pathway | Cell cycle regulation and apoptosis | TP53, CDKN1A, BAX, GADD45 | DNA damage | Cell cycle arrest, apoptosis (when functional) |
| Cell Cycle Pathway | Regulation of cell division | CDKs, cyclins, CDKN2A (p16INK4a) | Various cellular signals | Control of cell proliferation |
| Retinoic Acid Pathway | Regulation of cell growth and differentiation | RARB, retinoic acid | Retinoic acid binding | Control of cell growth (when functional) |
