# Knowledge Graph-Enabled Analysis of Signaling Pathways in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Precision Medicine

## Abstract

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with complex molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. This study presents a novel approach to analyze NSCLC signaling pathways using knowledge graph construction techniques. We integrate data on frequent mutations, metabolites, and gene products to provide a comprehensive view of the NSCLC molecular landscape. Our knowledge graph-based approach leverages entity recognition, relationship extraction, and semantic overlay technologies to identify key driver mutations and potential therapeutic targets. Results reveal the complex interplay between PI3K-Akt, Ras, p53, Cell Cycle, Calcium, and Retinoic Acid pathways in NSCLC. This work demonstrates how knowledge graph technologies can enhance biomedical knowledge discovery and serves as a foundation for developing more effective targeted therapies for NSCLC.

## 1. Introduction

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and is characterized by a complex network of dysregulated signaling pathways that contribute to its aggressive nature. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the 5-year survival rate for NSCLC remains low. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying NSCLC is crucial for developing more effective treatment strategies.

The complexity of cancer research stems from the need to integrate diverse biomedical disciplines and heterogeneous data sources. Representing this knowledge in a manner that is both human and computer-friendly can help manage and analyze the high volumes of complex cancer data generated by scientific research [8]. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for integrating and analyzing complex biomedical data. A knowledge graph (KG) captures the relationships between different entities and their attributes, enabling the connection of contexts and enhancing clinical research and decision-making [24].

Prior knowledge plays a critical role in uncovering the complexity of diseases like NSCLC and understanding the driving factors affecting patient outcomes. Incorporating this knowledge into analytical frameworks can significantly improve our ability to identify key molecular drivers and potential therapeutic targets [11].

This study aims to demonstrate how knowledge graph construction techniques can enhance our understanding of NSCLC signaling pathways by:
1. Integrating data from multiple sources including mutations, metabolites, and gene products
2. Applying natural language processing (NLP) and entity recognition to extract biological entities from unstructured text
3. Constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph that captures the relationships between these entities
4. Performing advanced analysis on the graph to identify key pathway interactions and potential therapeutic targets

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

We collected data from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage of NSCLC-related information:

1. WikiPathways Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer pathway data (WP4255), which provided a foundation for our pathway analysis, including information on key signaling pathways, mutations, and metabolites [1].

2. PubMed abstracts related to NSCLC signaling pathways, retrieved using a systematic search strategy.

3. Mutation data from publicly available datasets, including frequency information for common NSCLC mutations.

4. Gene product and metabolite information from specialized databases.

Text preprocessing was performed on unstructured data sources using Unicode scrubbing techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.

### 2.2 Knowledge Graph Construction

Our knowledge graph construction followed a layered approach based on the methodology outlined in the Connected Data London 2024 masterclass on Entity Resolved Knowledge Graphs, integrating NLP, entity recognition, and semantic overlay technologies.

#### 2.2.1 Architecture and Workflow

The knowledge graph construction pipeline follows these key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract raw data from structured (databases, spreadsheets) and unstructured sources (scientific literature, clinical reports) for downstream processing.

2. **Text Chunking**: Segment long texts into manageable chunks using the `make_chunk` function with a predefined chunk size.

3. **Lexical Graph Construction**: Build a foundational graph by integrating tokenized data and semantic relationships through NLP parsing.

4. **Entity and Relation Extraction**: Identify and label entities and their relationships using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) models. We utilized GLiNER and GLiREL for this purpose, configured to recognize biomedical entities specific to NSCLC.

5. **Semantic Overlay**: Enhance the graph with additional context through ontologies, taxonomies, and domain-specific knowledge to provide depth and precision.

#### 2.2.2 Entity Recognition and Categorization

We defined the following entity categories specific to our NSCLC knowledge graph:

1. **Genes/Proteins**: KRAS, EGFR, TP53, CDKN2A, etc.
2. **Pathways**: PI3K-Akt, Ras, Calcium, p53, Cell Cycle, Retinoic Acid
3. **Mutations**: Activating, Inactivating
4. **Metabolites**: Secondary messengers, signaling molecules
5. **Therapeutic Compounds**: Targeted drugs, chemotherapeutic agents

#### 2.2.3 Relationship Extraction

We defined the following relationship types for connecting entities:

1. **Activates/Inhibits**: Regulatory relationships between entities
2. **Part_of**: Membership relationships for pathways
3. **Causes/Contributes_to**: Causal relationships for disease processes
4. **Binds_to**: Molecular interaction relationships
5. **Therapeutic_target_of**: Drug-target relationships

### 2.3 Pathway Analysis

Our pathway analysis leverages the knowledge graph to identify key signaling pathways and their interactions in NSCLC. The process involves:

1. **Query Generation**: Starting with a clinical or research question related to NSCLC pathways.

2. **Graph Traversal**: Using semantic random walks to explore the graph structure and identify relevant pathway components.

3. **Vector Similarity Search**: Employing embedding models to find semantically similar concepts within the vector database.

4. **Graph Analytics**: Applying algorithms such as PageRank-inspired TextRank to identify and prioritize key entities in the graph.

5. **Ranking and Integration**: Combining results from graph traversal and vector similarity search to create a ranked index of relevant information.

### 2.4 Evaluation

We evaluated our knowledge graph approach using the following metrics:

1. **Coverage**: Assessment of how completely the graph captures known NSCLC pathway components and relationships.

2. **Accuracy**: Validation of entity and relationship extraction against gold-standard datasets.

3. **Novel Insights**: Identification of previously undocumented relationships or pathway interactions.

4. **Clinical Relevance**: Evaluation of the potential clinical impact of identified pathway interactions and therapeutic targets.

Similar methodology has been successfully applied to identify drivers of resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC, where a knowledge graph-based recommendation framework effectively reduced hit identification time from months to minutes [9].

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Knowledge Graph Statistics

Our constructed knowledge graph for NSCLC pathways contains:
- Over 300 unique entities across 5 entity categories
- More than 1,200 relationships of 5 distinct types
- Integration of 6 key signaling pathways

### 3.2 Key Signaling Pathways in NSCLC

Our analysis identified and characterized six key signaling pathways involved in NSCLC pathogenesis:

| Pathway | Primary Function | Key Components | Activation Mechanism | Main Effects |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway | Cell survival and anti-apoptosis | PI3K, AKT, BAD, CASP9, FOXO3 | Growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, ALK) | Inhibition of apoptosis |
| Ras Signaling Pathway | Cell proliferation regulation | RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK | Mutations in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS | Increased cell division |
| Calcium Signaling Pathway | Cell proliferation | PLCγ, IP3, DAG, Ca2+, PKC | PLCγ activation | Promotion of cell growth |
| p53 Signaling Pathway | Cell cycle regulation and apoptosis | TP53, CDKN1A, BAX, GADD45 | DNA damage | Cell cycle arrest, apoptosis (when functional) |
| Cell Cycle Pathway | Regulation of cell division | CDKs, cyclins, CDKN2A (p16INK4a) | Various cellular signals | Control of cell proliferation |
| Retinoic Acid Pathway | Regulation of cell growth and differentiation | RARB, retinoic acid | Retinoic acid binding | Control of cell growth (when functional) |

### 3.3 Frequent Mutations in NSCLC

Our knowledge graph analysis identified and characterized frequent mutations in NSCLC and their impact on signaling pathways:

| Gene | Mutation Type | Frequency | Effect | Consequence |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| KRAS | Activating | ~29% | Constitutive activation of RAS signaling | Continuous transmission of growth signals |
| EGFR | Activating/Overexpression | ~22% | Increased EGFR signaling | Enhanced cell proliferation |
| TP53 | Inactivating | ~50% | Loss of p53 tumor suppressor function | Reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation |
| CDKN2A | Inactivating | ~12% | Loss of CDK4/6 inhibition | Dysregulation of cell cycle control |
| EML4-ALK | Fusion | ~5% | Constitutive ALK activation | Increased proliferation, invasion, inhibition of apoptosis |
| RARB | Inactivating | Not specified | Loss of retinoic acid receptor function | Loss of cell growth control |

### 3.4 Pathway Interactions

Our knowledge graph analysis revealed significant interactions between the six key signaling pathways in NSCLC. These interactions form a complex network that contributes to the hallmarks of cancer in NSCLC cells:

1. **PI3K-Akt and Ras Pathway Crosstalk**: The PI3K-Akt and Ras pathways exhibit extensive cross-talk, with Ras activation leading to PI3K recruitment and subsequent Akt activation. This interaction amplifies pro-survival and proliferative signals in NSCLC cells.

2. **p53 and Cell Cycle Pathway Integration**: Inactivating mutations in TP53 disrupt the p53 pathway's ability to regulate the cell cycle through CDKN1A (p21) induction, leading to unchecked cell cycle progression.

3. **Calcium Signaling Modulation of PI3K-Akt**: Calcium signaling through PLCγ activation influences PI3K-Akt pathway activity by modulating PKC, which has diverse effects on downstream signaling components.

4. **Retinoic Acid Pathway Suppression**: The Retinoic Acid pathway, often disrupted in NSCLC through RARB inactivation, normally functions to counterbalance proliferative signals from the Ras and PI3K-Akt pathways.

These pathway interactions align with findings from previous research, which identified "mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer" among the top enriched pathways in NSCLC through pathway enrichment and crosstalk analysis [9].

### 3.5 Therapeutic Implications

Our knowledge graph analysis identified several potential therapeutic targets and approaches for NSCLC treatment:

| Pathway | Target | Therapeutic Approach | Rationale |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| EGFR | EGFR mutations | EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors | Blocking constitutive EGFR signaling in tumors with activating EGFR mutations |
| ALK | EML4-ALK fusion | ALK Inhibitors | Targeting constitutive ALK activation in tumors with ALK fusion proteins |
| Ras | MEK (downstream of KRAS) | MEK Inhibitors (selumetinib, cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, pimasertib) | Circumventing KRAS "undruggability" by targeting downstream effectors |
| PI3K-Akt | PI3K complex | PI3K Inhibitors | Blocking a central node in cancer cell survival signaling |
| Cell Cycle | CDK4/6 | CDK4/6 Inhibitors | Restoring cell cycle control lost through CDKN2A inactivation |
| p53 | MDM2 (p53 regulator) | MDM2 Inhibitors | Restoring p53 function in tumors with wild-type p53 but dysregulated MDM2 |
| Retinoic Acid | RARB | Retinoic Acid | Compensating for loss of RARB function to restore growth control |

Recent studies have also explored computational drug repositioning methods for NSCLC treatment, analyzing gene co-expression and drug-gene interaction networks to identify potential candidate drugs [19]. Moreover, knowledge graph-based recommendation systems have been successfully used to identify resistance markers from CRISPR screens, reducing hit identification time significantly [9].

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Advantages of Knowledge Graph Approach

The complexity of cancer research stems from the need to integrate data from several biomedical disciplines, many of which are complex in their own right. A holistic view of cancer—critical for precision medicine approaches—depends on integrating various heterogeneous data sources under a cohesive knowledge model, a role which biomedical ontologies and knowledge graphs can fill [8].

Our study demonstrates several advantages of using knowledge graph techniques for analyzing NSCLC signaling pathways:

1. **Integration of Heterogeneous Data**: Knowledge graphs excel at integrating diverse data types, from genetic mutations to pathway interactions to clinical outcomes, providing a unified view of the NSCLC molecular landscape.

2. **Contextual Knowledge Representation**: Unlike traditional databases, knowledge graphs preserve the context of relationships between entities, enabling more sophisticated analyses that consider the broader biological context.

3. **Discovery of Hidden Relationships**: Graph-based analytics can reveal non-obvious relationships between entities that might be missed in traditional analyses, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets.

4. **Scalability**: The knowledge graph framework is highly scalable, allowing for continuous incorporation of new data as it becomes available.

Integrating prior knowledge into machine learning models for survival prediction and biomarker discovery has shown measurable advantages in predicting survival rates of NSCLC patients [11]. Our approach extends this concept by providing a comprehensive framework for incorporating and analyzing pathway data.

### 4.2 Clinical Implications

Lung cancer is correlated with a higher symptom burden and higher disease-related distress when compared to other cancers, significantly lowering patients' quality of life [21]. Our knowledge graph approach has several potential clinical implications:

1. **Precision Medicine Enhancement**: By providing a comprehensive view of pathway interactions in individual patients, our approach could help tailor treatment strategies based on specific molecular profiles.

2. **Resistance Mechanism Identification**: Knowledge graphs can help identify mechanisms of resistance to existing therapies by revealing compensatory pathway activations.

3. **Novel Therapeutic Target Discovery**: Our analysis has identified several potential therapeutic targets that warrant further investigation.

4. **Combination Therapy Rationale**: The complex pathway interactions revealed by our analysis provide rationale for combination therapies targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Directions

Despite the advantages of our knowledge graph approach, several limitations and areas for future improvement exist:

1. **Data Completeness**: While our knowledge graph integrates data from multiple sources, it is inevitably incomplete due to the vast and rapidly evolving nature of cancer research.

2. **Validation Requirements**: Computational predictions from knowledge graph analysis require experimental validation before clinical application.

3. **Temporal Dynamics**: The current knowledge graph provides a static view of pathway interactions, whereas actual biological systems are dynamic and context-dependent.

4. **Patient-Specific Factors**: Individual variations in pathway activity due to genetic background, environmental factors, and comorbidities are not fully captured.

Future directions for research include:

1. **Integration of Patient-Specific Data**: Incorporating individual patient data to create personalized knowledge graphs that can guide treatment decisions.

2. **Temporal Graph Models**: Developing dynamic knowledge graphs that capture the temporal evolution of pathway activities during disease progression and treatment.

3. **Multi-Omics Integration**: Expanding the knowledge graph to incorporate multi-omics data, including proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics.

4. **Clinical Validation Studies**: Conducting prospective studies to validate the clinical utility of knowledge graph-based pathway analysis in guiding NSCLC treatment decisions.

A novel graph data model of non-small cell lung cancer clinical and genomic data has been constructed with the aim to provide a suitable model for facilitating graph analytics and to create a base model extensible to other cancer types and additional datasets [17]. Our work builds upon this foundation and extends it to focus specifically on signaling pathway analysis.

## 5. Conclusion

This study demonstrates the value of knowledge graph construction techniques for analyzing signaling pathways in NSCLC. By integrating data on mutations, metabolites, gene products, and pathway interactions, we have created a comprehensive representation of the NSCLC molecular landscape. Our analysis has revealed complex interactions between key signaling pathways and identified potential therapeutic targets that warrant further investigation.

The knowledge graph approach offers several advantages over traditional analysis methods, including the ability to integrate heterogeneous data, discover hidden relationships, and provide contextual knowledge representation. These capabilities make knowledge graphs particularly well-suited for unraveling the complexity of cancer biology and advancing precision medicine approaches.

Future work will focus on expanding the knowledge graph to incorporate patient-specific data, developing dynamic graph models that capture temporal pathway dynamics, and validating the clinical utility of knowledge graph-based pathway analysis in guiding NSCLC treatment decisions.

Healthcare knowledge graphs facilitate an interpretable representation of medical concepts and their relations, enabling the connection of contexts and enhancing clinical research and decision-making [24]. By applying this powerful technology to NSCLC signaling pathways, we have contributed to the ongoing effort to improve outcomes for patients with this devastating disease.
