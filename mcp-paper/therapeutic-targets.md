| Pathway | Target | Therapeutic Approach | Rationale |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| EGFR | EGFR mutations | EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors | Blocking constitutive EGFR signaling in tumors with activating EGFR mutations |
| ALK | EML4-ALK fusion | ALK Inhibitors | Targeting constitutive ALK activation in tumors with ALK fusion proteins |
| Ras | MEK (downstream of KRAS) | MEK Inhibitors (selumetinib, cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib, pimasertib) | Circumventing KRAS "undruggability" by targeting downstream effectors |
| PI3K-Akt | PI3K complex | PI3K Inhibitors | Blocking a central node in cancer cell survival signaling |
| Cell Cycle | CDK4/6 | CDK4/6 Inhibitors | Restoring cell cycle control lost through CDKN2A inactivation |
| p53 | MDM2 (p53 regulator) | MDM2 Inhibitors | Restoring p53 function in tumors with wild-type p53 but dysregulated MDM2 |
| Retinoic Acid | RARB | Retinoic Acid | Compensating for loss of RARB function to restore growth control |
