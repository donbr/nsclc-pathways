I'll create a 5-10 minute script that walks users through using Claude Desktop with MCP servers to help jumpstart life sciences research by creating draft outlines for papers. This script will focus on practical applications of knowledge graph construction for biomedical research.

# Claude Desktop for Life Sciences Research: Knowledge Graph-Enabled Paper Drafting

## Introduction (1 minute)

Welcome to this quick walkthrough of Claude Desktop with MCP servers for life sciences research! Today, I'll show you how Model Context Protocol servers can help you rapidly create knowledge graph-enabled paper outlines, specifically for biomedical research topics like the NSCLC signaling pathway example we have here.

The power of Claude with MCP is that it can help you connect disparate pieces of information, identify key relationships in complex biological systems, and organize this knowledge into a cohesive structure for your research papers.

## Setup Configuration (1-2 minutes)

First, let's make sure your system is properly configured:

1. We need the `claude_desktop_config.json` file which contains the MCP server connections
2. For our life sciences knowledge graph work, we'll primarily use:
   - The filesystem server to access your research files
   - Qdrant for vector search of related concepts
   - Brave search for retrieving up-to-date research
   - Sequential thinking for complex reasoning about biological pathways

The configuration we see in your files already has these properly set up, with placeholders for your Qdrant API keys and collection names.

## Project Walkthrough (3-4 minutes)

Let's walk through an example of creating a knowledge graph for a research paper on signaling pathways in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:

1. **Start with your source data**: We'll use the NSCLC knowledge graph paper as our source material

2. **Create initial entity types**: For biomedical knowledge graphs, we typically want:
   - Genes/Proteins (e.g., KRAS, EGFR, TP53)
   - Pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt, Ras, p53)
   - Mutations (e.g., Activating, Inactivating)
   - Metabolites and other biomolecules
   - Therapeutic compounds

3. **Define relationship types**:
   - Activates/Inhibits
   - Part_of (for pathway components)
   - Causes/Contributes_to
   - Binds_to
   - Therapeutic_target_of

4. **Extract entities and relationships** using Claude and MCP servers

5. **Analyze the network** to identify key pathway interactions

## Interactive Demo (2-3 minutes)

Let's demonstrate this with Claude and MCP servers:

1. First, we'll create a new knowledge graph for our NSCLC pathway research
2. We'll extract key entities from our source paper
3. We'll establish relationships between these entities
4. We'll query the knowledge graph to identify critical pathway interactions
5. Finally, we'll generate a structured paper outline based on our findings

Let me show you how each step works with appropriate function calls to the MCP servers:

```
1. Use the filesystem server to access the NSCLC paper
2. Use sequential thinking to analyze the pathways
3. Create entities and relationships for the knowledge graph
4. Use the Qdrant server to store and query the knowledge
5. Generate the paper outline with sections for each major pathway
```

## Benefits for Life Sciences Research (1 minute)

This approach offers several advantages for biomedical researchers:

1. **Data Integration**: Combines information from multiple sources into a unified framework
2. **Insight Discovery**: Reveals hidden connections between biological entities
3. **Literature Consolidation**: Automatically extracts and organizes information from research papers
4. **Hypothesis Generation**: Identifies potential new research directions
5. **Time Efficiency**: Reduces the time needed to synthesize complex information

## Conclusion (1 minute)

With Claude Desktop and properly configured MCP servers, you can quickly create sophisticated knowledge graphs for your life sciences research. This approach helps you identify key relationships in complex biological systems and organize this knowledge into well-structured paper outlines.

The walkthrough we've just seen demonstrates how to start with raw research papers, extract meaningful biological entities and relationships, and create a foundation for your next breakthrough paper in fields like cancer biology, drug discovery, or precision medicine.
