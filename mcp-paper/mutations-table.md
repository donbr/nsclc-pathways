| Gene | Mutation Type | Frequency | Effect | Consequence |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| KRAS | Activating | ~29% | Constitutive activation of RAS signaling | Continuous transmission of growth signals |
| EGFR | Activating/Overexpression | ~22% | Increased EGFR signaling | Enhanced cell proliferation |
| TP53 | Inactivating | ~50% | Loss of p53 tumor suppressor function | Reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation |
| CDKN2A | Inactivating | ~12% | Loss of CDK4/6 inhibition | Dysregulation of cell cycle control |
| EML4-ALK | Fusion | ~5% | Constitutive ALK activation | Increased proliferation, invasion, inhibition of apoptosis |
| RARB | Inactivating | Not specified | Loss of retinoic acid receptor function | Loss of cell growth control |
